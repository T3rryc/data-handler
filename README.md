# Data handler

Namir Salaheddine

### Simple data handling (input, updating, retrieval and removal) using C++ Data Structures and Binary Search
#### For this exercise you will need to:
- Build a data type of your choice (class, struct), to represent one real-world set of entities (e.g. Students, Cars, Products, etc.). Think of appropriate attributes in each case (e.g. year of enrolment, name, etc.)
- Create instances/objects of your data type and store them in a Data Structure of your choice (e.g. list, vector, BST). Optimally, the data structure should follow your own implementation. Data can be randomly generated.
- Implement addition, retrieval, updating and removal functionalities, through a simple console menu.
- Implement a version of Merge Sort, to sort your data structure based on a "sortable" attribute (e.g. year of enrolment, name)
- Support any function that depends on search (retrieval, updating and removal), with your implementation of Binary Search (or, optionally, a suitable tree structure).
- Maintain a public remote repository on GitHub, with just the necessary documentation on how to build and run your code. Include a short description about what your project does and what limitations it may have (bugs, unfinished tasks, etc.).

**Deadline: Sunday 12/1, 12:00 PM**

#### How to build and run the code:
  - Clone the repository
  - Open the project in the terminal
     - On the terminal in the project directory, compile the source files with the following command (requires g++ compiler):
    ```
    g++ main.cpp -o main
    ```
    and run the executable with the following command:
    ```
    ./main.exe
    ```
  - OR open the project in VSCode
    - Add the C/C++ extension and Code Runner extension
	- Open the main.cpp file and run the code by pressing the run button on the top right corner of the editor (requires g++ compiler)
